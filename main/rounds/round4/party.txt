The penguins from all over the world look at Private, to his delight. Baby penguins pop out from behind parent penguins.

Skipper: Yes, sir. You are the most meaningful and valued member of this team.

Private salutes Skipper, who salutes back. Kowalski and Rico salute as well. Skipper does Private's salute by crossing his eyes and sticking out his tongue. Private did the same and laughs. All the penguins and the North Wind cheer for Private. Penguin #1: Way to go, Private! Penguin #2: Attaboy! Corporal: Nicely done. Penguin #3: Whoo-hoo! Penguin #4: Way to go, Private! You did it! Penguin #5: We're so proud of you! Penguin #6: You saved us! Penguin #7: We love you, Private! Penguin #8: Yeah, we love you! Penguin #9: You the penguin! Cricket: Huh? Skipper: Ramirez! Kowalski: Dave. Skipper: Dave! Dave: What? Are you kidding me?! Skipper: Dave... aw, look at you. Dave: You think this is over? I'm just getting started. I'm about to... Kowalski: What do we do with him now? Girl: Aw… Dave: Open this right now! Skipper: Here you go, kid. Girl: Cool! Skipper: I hope you find happiness, Dave. Girl: It's snowing! It's snowing! It's snowing! It's snowing! It's snowing! It's snowing... Classified: [clear his throat] Right now, this is difficult for me to say, but... Skipper: Is it 'osteoporosis'? You just gotta lean into the vowels. Ahhh-stee-ohhhh-pahhh... Classified: No, no, I want to say... You four are the bravest agents I've ever known. The point is, I was wrong about you. And I hope there's some way I can make it right. Kowalski: [to Classified] Give us jetpacks. Eva: [at the same time; to Kowalski] We should kiss. Kowalski: [notices Eva] Whoa! Uh, [clears his throat] did... did you just say...

Eva dips Kowalski, kissing him, while using her other wing to block the camera, to the disgust of Kowalski's comrades. Skipper covers Private's eyes, while Rico almost throws up. As soon as Eva lowers her wing, Kowalski has lipstick marks all over his face.

Kowalski: Well, that feels right! Private: I think I'd actually prefer a jet pack, please. Skipper: Ooh! I think we should go with Private's idea. Kowalski: Yeah! Skipper: Kowalski! What's our trajectory? Kowalski: 95% certain this will end in massive... flaming disaster! Skipper: And the other five percent? Kowalski: Irrelevant, sir! Jet packs are awesome! Skipper: Agreed! Private: Who says penguins can't fly? Skipper: Yee-haw! Boo-yah! Private: Um… Skipper, we are going to turn me back to normal, right? Skipper: Absolutely. First thing Monday. Mort: Whee! I'm in a rocket ship! King Julien: I want to push the button. Kowalski: Give me that! King Julien: Hey! Stealer! Private: Let's do this! I'm ready! King Julien: Okay, on three. One, three, go. I'm just gonna do a little practice push. Okay, I'm not going to press it. Why are you smacking my hand? Hey, look over there! Mort: I'm a laser show. Shoot, shoot! Kowalski: Julien! Private: Hey! Skipper: Now, that's the Private we know and love. High one! Kowalski: Immeasurable cuteness, right there! Private: Good to be back. Mort: I feel like a French fry! I'm okay! Skipper: And with cuteness to spare! Come on! Frosty mugs of herring juice all around! Private's buying. Private: What? King Julien: What? You know, if I'm being honest, I expected a little more... pizzazz!

(Mort swallows Julien whole.)

King Julien: Yes! Now, that's pizzazz!
