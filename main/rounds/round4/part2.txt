Classified: What you, of course, could not know is that Dr. Brine's laboratory in Venice is secretly developing a doomsday weapon called the "Medusa Serum." Skipper: Ah, but what you don't know is that Dirk... Kowalski: Dave. Skipper: Dave won't be using his Bazooka Serum... Kowalski: Medusa Serum. Skipper: Medusa Serum on anybody. Kowalski: That part is accurate. Skipper: Show him, Rico.

Rico spits out the vial containing the Medusa Serum.

Classified: You... you stole the Medusa Serum. Skipper: Well, stole the serum, saved the day, did your job for you. Call it what you will.

Suddenly, the screen goes on, revealing Dave.

Skipper: Debbie! Kowalski: Dave. Skipper: Dave! Corporal: He hacked into our system.

There's no sound on-screen as Dave speaks.

Eva: Where's the sound? Kowalski: Dave, your microphone, it's not on. Classified: Click on the button with the picture of the microphone. Short Fuse: Every time a villain calls in, this happens. Dave: Hello?

[the screen goes off]

Dave: Hello? Kowalski: Well, now we can hear you. Short Fuse: So annoying! Kowalski: But we cannot see you. Short Fuse: Every time! Classified: It's like talking to my parents. Dave: How about now? [comes back on-screen]

Everyone cheers in agreement.

Private: Hurray! Corporal: Great! Classified: Yes! We've got you. That's fantastic. Dave: Excellent! Now, where was I? [starts doing an evil laugh] Kowalski: Dave!

Short Fuse growls.

Dave: Greetings, North Wind. I see you've met my old zoo mates. Skipper: We were never mates. There was no mating. Classified: Turn in yourself, David. You're powerless now that I've stolen you precious Medusa Serum. Skipper: What? You? You didn't steal that! Classified: It's over. Dave: It's over? Then why did I call you? Weird. Oh, maybe it was to show you this!

As soon as Dave turns the camera to show them a giant vial containing the Medusa Serum, everyone gasps in shock.

Kowalski: That is a lot of serum for four penguins. Dave: Oh, you thought this was just about you four? No. No, no, no, no. We're just getting started.

Dave takes a selfie with a camera.

Dave: Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go do some shopping... for revenge!

Dave presses the button to turn off the screen but nothing happens. He presses it again but still nothing happens.

Dave: Wait. How do you...?

Dave turns to his octopus thugs for help.

Dave: What do I push? Is it the red? Or... I thought it was...it's not this...

Dave presses something and the screen goes blank. The picture of Dave in front of the serum comes out of the printer. Then an alarm starts blaring.

Eva: Incoming alert. Classified: Put it on the screen. Eva: The Berlin Zoo... 15 penguins missing. Private: Dave's kidnapping other penguins! Corporal: No doubt cute and cuddly. Classified and Skipper: We have to move! What? Classified [simultaneously with Skipper]: Time for our A-game. Skipper [simultaneously with Classified]: Everybody, huddle up. Classified: Corporal, ready the jet. I'm initiating North Wind Protocol Zeta. Eva: 12 more penguins taken from London Zoo. Skipper: Okay, boys, this is it. The mission we've been preparing for our entire lives. We're gonna take down Dave or die trying. Kowalski, cancel our improv class! Kowalski: Yes, sir. Skipper: Rico, equipify. Rico: Hai! Skipper: Private, do that little thing I like.

Private salutes while making a silly face.

Skipper: It's still funny. Kowalski: Skipper, good news. I got them to credit our class. Corporal: Sir, the jet is ready. Skipper: Oh, yeah, baby! Just like Super Bowl 19! Private: Whee! Short Fuse: They're stealing my stuff!

Rico swallows a missile.

Classified: No! This mission has no place for a pathetic waddle of useless penguins! Skipper: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Who are you calling pathetic? Classified: Enough!

Classified bangs the table, causing Rico to spit out the missile which destroys the jet.

Skipper: See, Rico, that's why you can't have nice things.

Classified starts hitting the penguins with tranquilizer darts, rendering them unconscious.

Private: Ooh! Kowalski: You know, [dart hits him] hoo… I'm pretty good with computers myself.

Corporal puts the sleeping penguins in a small cardboard box.

Short Fuse: Put on your jammies, penguin. Corporal: Aw… Eva: They are even cute when they're asleep. Short Fuse: Not to me. Classified: I want these butterballs out of my way and out of my mission. Ship them to one of our safe houses. The most remote place on the planet.

Corporal closes the box. Cut to inside of a plane heading to Madagascar.

Skipper: Ugh, where the heck are we? Kowalski: Oxygen content is low. I suggest we limit our breathing.

Then the sound of a fart broke the silence.

Skipper: Aw, Private!

The three Penguins rip holes on the box to breathe for air.

Private: Sorry. I get gassy when I fly. Skipper: Toot sweet! He does! Kowalski: We must be on a plane!

The Penguins move the box to be free. Skipper, Kowalski and Rico have darts on their necks and Private has a dart on his butt.

Kowalski: What did North Wind do to us? Private: Oh! They gave us badges!

All but Private take off the darts.

Skipper: Not badges, tranquilizer darts! Classified! That low-down dirty dog is trying to kick us off the mission! Kowalski: He thinks we can't save the penguins because we're just “penguins”. Skipper: Well, penguins are our flesh and feathers! They're us! And if anyone's gonna save us, it's us. Kowalski: But, Skipper, we've gotta be five miles up. That pretty much limits our options. Skipper: I make my own options. Kowalski: Brilliant move, Skipper, but now we seem to be outside the plane. Skipper: Well, kind of got caught up in the moment. Well, hindsight's 20/20. Okay, Kowalski, your turn to pick up the slack. Kowalski: Uh… Private: Oh, why don't we catch that plane? Pilot: Bird strike, log it. Kowalski: We've got another target at 12 o'clock. Skipper: Good, it's only 11:30. Follow me, boys! We're going in hot.

Private starts burning like a meteor.

Skipper: No one likes a show-off, Private. Kowalski: Aim for first class! Private: I'm okay! Skipper: Kowalski, where does this aircraft go? Kowalski: From the odd shape of this bagel, I'd say we're headed for Paris. Skipper: France? Forget it! Not with their tax laws! Kowalski: Then I would suggest a mid-air transfer. Skipper: Affirmative. Private: Peanuts! Peanuts! Peanuts, peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut, peanut! We're out of peanuts, Skipper! Skipper: Try pretzels, Private. Bingo. There's our ride, boys. Can't stay, doll. Danger is my mistress. Ah! Rico, more height. Private: Pretzels! Pretzels! Pretzel, pretzel, pretzels! We're out of pretzels! Skipper: Yeah? Then we're leaving just time, 'cause these folks are gonna freak! Kowalski: Deploy flaps. Skipper: Stay on target! Private: We're gonna catch it, we're gonna catch it! Crikey! We're not gonna catch it! Kowalski: Wait a minute, where's Skipper? Skipper: Time to get creative. Start grabbing boxes, boys. Private: Going long! Skipper: Oh, Private, stop playing with those backpacks. Find something useful. Now we're talking. Let's get to work. Kowalski: 400 meters. 300 meters. Skipper: Speak American, Kowalski! Kowalski: Sorry, sir. 218 yards. 109 yards. Skipper: Okay, then. It's clear what we need to do next. Kowalski: That feels right. Skipper: Impressive bouncing, boys. Now, then, back to civilization. If we're gonna take Dexter down, we need to know where he's gonna strike next. Brazilian Penguin: Yeah! Brazilian Penguins: Goal! Dr. Octavius Brine: Elijah, would you please take them away. Eva: Penguin footprints, still warm. We just missed Dave. Classified: Blast it, he's gone. Corporal: So many penguins! Aah! Short Fuse: Boss! He's stress-eating again! Classified: Corporal? Eva: There, there. Short Fuse: Rub the angry out of the tummy. Classified: Corporal? Fo... focus. We are going to save those helpless penguins, because... we are the North Wind, and no one... no one breaks the Wind. Corporal: No one breaks the Wind. Classified: There's a good Corporal. Now, we rescued those four penguins already, didn't we? Shipped them off all cozy and snug to a Madagascar safe... How come there's beeping? Eva: Sir, those penguins... They never made it to Madagascar. Classified: What? Well, where the dickens are they? Skipper: Kowalski, what are our coordinates? Kowalski: From my calculations, we've arrived in the center of Dublin, Ireland.

[Shanghai]

Skipper: All right, soldiers, we got to blend in. Riverdance. No time to kiss the Blarney stone, boys. We need to find intel on Dave's location, pronto. Aha! All right, you, where's Dave! Give us the goods. Spit it out! Don't make me use shillelagh! Kowalski: Sir, that's... That's a baby squid. Skipper: Sorry, laddie. Ugh. Stranded on the Emerald Isle without a single clue. Well, so much for the luck o' the Irish. Kowalski: Skipper, look! Skipper: Huh? Begorrah! Does anyone speak Gaelic? Kowalski: No. But it looks like Dave's been busy. He's stolen penguins from Guadalajara! Private: Madrid! Skipper: Paris! Kowalski: Athens! Skipper: Bangalore! Kowalski: Dusseldorf! Private: Osaka! Kowalski: Rio de Janeiro! Private: Nairobi! Skipper: Amsterdam! Private: Baton Rouge! Skipper: Dave's snow globe collection. Kowalski: It's every zoo and aquarium he got kicked out of! Skipper: Don't tell me where he has been, tell me where he will have has been next.

Rico starts gagging.

Skipper: Wait, what is it, Rico? It's a book! It's a film! It's a play! First word. Two syllables. Sounds like “huyh”... Sounds like "huuh"? Sounds like "hyech!" What starts with "hyech"?

Rico spits out Dave's Shanghai snow globe.

Skipper: Shanghai. Kowalski: Dave hasn't been there yet, Skipper. If we hurry, we can still stop him. Skipper: Nice work, Rico. Pack your bagpipes, boys. It's time to blow this potato stand. So this is it. Shanghai's famous Little Dublin district. Private: Skipper, look! Skipper: I see you, Private. Who's the big boy standing on his tippy-toes? Private: Wha...? No, I mean... Skipper: I just want to eat you up. Kowalski: Skipper, look! Above Private! Dave's next target... Shanghai's famous mermaid penguins. Skipper: Good eye, Kowalski. And once again, you've proved that you are a meaningful and valued member of this team. Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, Shanghai Marine World is pleased to present our world-famous Mermaid Penguins! Tonight, our mermaids dedicate their performance to all the missing penguins around the world. Stay safe, little guys, wherever you are. And we hope you come home real soon. Skipper: Keep those eyes roving, boys. Dave is a master of disguise. He could be a small child, a house plant, maybe even you or me! Is it you, Kowalski? Kid: Hey, hold on. Huh? Ha! Skipper: Wait a minute. Bingo! Nice try, Dave! Operation Flash, Splash and Crash is a go! Kowalski: Splendid! Skipper: Take positions. Announcer: Penguin feeding time will begin in two minutes. Skipper: Target, 30 yards and closing. Kowalski: In position, Skipper. Skipper: Rico, report. Rico: In position. Skipper: For you, Private. Private: Yes, Skipper! Skipper: Here's your mermaid costume. Private: What? Skipper: We need a diversion. And, frankly, you're the only one who can pull off that look. Private: But I can do more, Skipper. I want to help the team. Really help the team. If you think I'm ready, which I am. Assuming you agree. And perhaps even... if you don't? Skipper: I like the moxie, soldier, but right now, I need a tail on that tush and the cutest smile you've got. You trust me, soldier? Private: Aye, aye, Skipper. Man: Hey, it's feeding time! Skipper: Target, ten yards from flashpoint. Private, you're up. You just mermaid my day. Flash is a go! Boy: Look, they let one of the mermaids out of the tank! Woman: Oh, she's so cute. Kid: It's the cutest thing I've ever seen. Skipper: Shields up! Target is stunned. Rico, bring the Splash. Rico: Yeah! Dr. Octavius Brine: Huh? Marine Worker: Oh, what are you doing out here, cutie? Come on. Back in your tank. Classified: Secure the mermaids and find me... David the octopus. Kowalski: A little late, North Wind. Skipper: Mission accomplished. High one! Classified: Corporal, take our prisoner... the one that belongs to us... into custody. What? Short Fuse: You melted him?! You birds are sick! Kowalski: He's going in through the pipes! Private: Skipper! Skipper: Private? Private! You got to get out of there! Skipper: No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Private! Private: Skipper! No! Kowalski: Okay. Here we go. Skipper: Move, move, move! He's got Private! He's getting away. He's getting away! Kowalski: Skipper, the North Wind's plane. Skipper: Sweet chariot of the gods! But can you fly it, man? Kowalski: There's only one way to find out. No, I... still can't read. Skipper: Then we're going off-book. Classified: No! No, no, no, no! Skipper: Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much! Kowalski: I'm getting the hang of this, Skipper. Eva: Pull off! Skipper: Good! We're coming for you, Private! Classified: Those ludicrous butterballs are letting David escape! Eva, secure transport. Short Fuse, Corporal, hitch us a ride. Short Fuse: Fire! Corporal: Go fetch. Classified: Hold her steady. Kowalski: Sir, Dave is pulling ahead. We are too heavy. Skipper: Oh, curse our heavily cheese-dibbled diet! Rico, give me a West Helsinki fire sale. Rico: Yeah, yeah. Skipper: Everything must go! Classified: What the... Kowalski: That's everything, sir. Skipper: Have you purged the chemical toilet? Kowalski: But Rico was in there for 15 minutes! Skipper: Just do it! Corporal: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Ship: Self-destruct sequence in five, Skipper: No, Private! Ship: four, three, two... Skipper: Stay strong soldier! Ship: ...one. Skipper: Skipper's log. Private has been kidnapped by Dave, while we have been cast adrift for what seems like days. No rations, fresh water... or land in sight. Kowalski's sick as a dog. And Rico keeps trying to eat him. Kowalski: Just, please, just cut it out. Skipper: Not sure how long we can hold on. This may be my final entry. Ow. Classified: 2004 Grand Cru. Hints of pear, white peaches. Eva: The salmon is delicious. Short Fuse: Oh, I have never been more hydrated in my life. Eva: Let me cut you a piece of the salmon. Classified: No, thank you. I'm stuffed. Eva: It's the most delicious thing on the boat. Classified: I have to loosen my utility belt. Short Fuse: No, I'm full. Just dump it in the ocean. Skipper: You know, we're all in the same boat here. Classified: Actually, we're not. And perhaps you could express a little more concern over the fact that you stole and destroyed a $19 million vehicle! Skipper: Bill me. Classified: Corporal? Corporal? Corporal: We're picking up a signal, sir. It's five klicks southwest, but it stopped at that remote island. Skipper: Land? Good on you. You've tracked down some land. Short Fuse: No, silly willy. We've been tracking your little secretary/mascot. Skipper: What? You put a homing device on Private? Classified: All of you, actually, when I darted you. Skipper: You low-down, dirty, mangy, filthy, flea-bitten, bum-sniffing toilet drinker! But... good. Classified: See, I told you. You should've left this to the professionals. Penguin: 892. 893. 894. 895. Dave: Ahoy there! Penguins. I bet you're all just dying to know why I brought you here. 'Mermaid Penguin: He's gonna kill us all! Dave: What? No. My Medusa Serum doesn't kill anyone. Where's the fun in that? Private: (feminine voice) So, um, what does it do? Dave: Something much, much worse. Private: (feminine voice) Right. But, like, what specifically? Dave: Well, that's exactly what I came up here to show you. All I need is a test subject. Hello, little buggy-boo! Cricket: Is this about the chirping? 'Cause I could... Whoa! Whoa! Dave: Behold, as I unleash the full power of the Medusa Serum. Fire! Yes! It works! I made a monster. I made a monster! And all you adorable penguins are next! Private: Crikey! Dave: Who said that? No. No. No. Yes! Gentlemen, you remember Private. Octopi: Oh, hey. Private: You'll never get away with this, Dave. My brothers are coming, and together we'll take a wrecking ball to your whole rotten operation. Dave: Call off the hunt, everyone. Turns out the elite unit will be coming to us. Boop. Classified: Eva? What do you see? Eva: My count is 30 hostiles. Kowalski: 31. Those two are very close together. I mean, you know, intertwined, physically, but... but not in... Skipper: Ixnay on the irtflay, Kowalski. Poor Private. Alone, helpless in the belly of that beast. Kowalski: We've faced some long odds before, Skipper, but these look like the longest and oddest. If we're gonna pull this off, we'll need a diversion. Camo Tech: Deactivating jungle camouflage. Classified: Shh! Would you be quiet? Skipper: Listen, Classified... Classified: Short Fuse, you were supposed to handcuff them to the rock! Skipper: Don't you hologram me! Short Fuse: I tried, but they don't have hands. They just have flippers, boss. And I have flippers! So it's flipping useless! Skipper:
