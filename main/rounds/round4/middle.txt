All right, pooch. If you won't work with us, you better work for us. Our plan requires a diversion. Classified: I give the orders around here. Much as it pains me, I need you to act as our diversion for our operation, understood? Skipper: Nope! This is our plan, and it requires you to cause a diversion. Classified: Die-version. Skipper: Dih-version. Classified: Die, die, die, die, die, die! Skipper: Dih, dih, dih, dih, dih, dih! Eva: Gentlemen, there is only one way to resolve this. Kowalski: We should kiss. Eva: Plan-off. Kowalski: Yep, plan-off. That's what I was gonna say. Plan-off. Skipper: Here's Dave's sub. And this young, helpless, vulnerable rock is Private. And here's Dave. While you four blowhards "dih-vert" the octopi, we strike fast and strike hard! Hi-yah! Get on in here, boys! Slap him silly, Rico! Come on! Kowalski, free the hostages! Now, that's what I'm talking about, big fella! With Private freshly liberated, we celebrate with a well-earned high one, and feast off Dave's sweet remains. Any questions? Whoa-hoa, hey, now! Classified: Wow. I mean, truly impressive. Especially the bit where you slap the fruit. Oh! Corporal, dim the lights. Short Fuse, glasses. Kowalski: Ooh. Classified: My apologies. Had to rush a bit. The schematic's a little crude. Skipper: Where is that music coming from? Kowalski: Wow. Classified: All right, at 2150, Skipper, Kowalski and... Richard, was it? Die-vert the octopi away from their posts. At 2200, Short Fuse breaches the hull with a swarm of self-guided underwater nano-charges. Short Fuse: I call them "wet kabooms." Classified: Yes, please don't. Short Fuse: Okay, sorry. Classified: At 2202, knock, knock. Corporal: Who's there? Classified: The North Wind. Corporal: The North Wind who? Classified: The North Wind who doesn't have time for knock-knock jokes because we're too busy taking down Dave. Personal hover tank... check. Auto-targeting wing mounts. Why not? At 2209, mission accomplished. See that? I don't even look back. There's a huge explosion, and I just keep walking. Short Fuse: Whoo! Way to go, boss! That's North Wind, sucker! Corporal: Nicely done. Skipper: La-di, blah, blah, blah, blah. A good plan is about more than effecty stuff and... vocabulary words. Classified: And you, you... you certainly know a good plan; I mean, your operation in Shanghai allowed Dave to escape with... your boy. I've never lost a member of my team. It must feel... awful. Can't imagine the guilt, the regret, the feeling that, I don't know, that... it should have been you.

The little rock transforms into Private who stares up at a tearful Skipper

Eva: All for penguin plan?

Kowalski and Rico raise their flippers

Eva: All for North Wind plan?

Everyone else, including Skipper, raise their paws, wings or flippers

Skipper: His... his is better.

Rico grunts in shock

Kowalski: What?

Skipper turns to his friends

Skipper: I'm sorry, boys, but I can't lead you this time.

Kowalski: But... we're a team, and... and you're our skipper, Skipper. We don't... we don't need these guys.

Skipper: No, Kowalski, but Private does. I think... it's time we leave it to the professionals.

Kowalski: But, sir...

Skipper: It's settled. We take our orders from Agent Classified now.

Rico (stammers): But… but…

That's an order, Rico! (Skipper waddles away. Then he stops) All right, Classified... what's the diversion?

Later on the dock…

We take this shame to our graves. Kowalski: Agreed. Octopi: Hey! Classified: Time? Eva: 2200 hours. Classified: Time to take down Dave. David the octopus, show me your tentacles. All of them. Short Fuse: Ow! Kowalski: We lost them, Skipper. Skipper: Not a moment too soon. These hosen are riding up my bundesliga. All right, boys, grab your coconuts and hold 'em tight. Classified should be walking away from a huge explosion with Private on his shoulder in three... two... Give 'em a welcome home, Rico! Skipper: Woo-hoo! Yeah! In your face, Dave! Kowalski: Private is back! Skipper: Welcome home, Private! Kowalski: Yeah! All right! Here we go. All right. Sir, the sub didn't explode, and... I fear the... fireworks may have been a tactical mistake. Short Fuse: Stay calm! Do not panic! We will still win! Be full of love! Don't hate! Follow your dreams! Love yourself! Love other people! Pick and choose your battles in life! Don't let anyone tell you what to do! Ignore the haters! Love the one you're with! Love the one you're with! Kowalski: Eva. I know. Dave: Welcome, Skipper, Kowalski and rootin'-tootin' Rico! The gang's all here! The mood is electric! Is this really, finally everybody? Skipper: All right, Dave, just what have you done with... Private! Private: Oh! Guys! You're in for it now, Dave! Dave: Really?! Anyway, great catching up. Now. Who's ready to move on to live penguins testing? Skipper: You point that death ray away from Private right now! Private: It's not a death ray, Skipper! He's gonna turn us into monsters! Dave: Yepper-doo! "And what comes next, Dave?" Invasion! Ahhh! Horrible mutant penguins released on the streets of New York City! Kowalski: You're the monster! Dave: Yes! I'm the monster. Everyone made that clear to me, every day of my entire life. But now, let's see how much everyone loves you when you're the monster! Private: Skipper! Skipper: You can't take away Private's cuteness! Kowalski: He's the cute one!

Rico grunts in agreement.

Kowalski: That-That's his thing!
Private: What?
Skipper: IT'S ALL THE LITTLE GUY'S GOT!

Private sighs, as if to say "Seriously?".

Dave: Hmm, you are super cute. We'd better crank this up. Drew, Barry, more power! Ready? Kowalski: Negotiations have broken down. Skipper: Rico, the paper clip! Bust us out of here! We need that paper clip! Chop-chop, soldier! No! Where's the paper clip? Private! No! Private... Kowalski: Oh no. Dave: I disintegrated him. That wasn't supposed to happen. Kowalski: You maniac! You blew him up! Skipper: No... Dave: Oh well. This is why we test things, people. I'll have to lower the power for the others. Full speed ahead, gentlemen. The monsters are due in Manhattan! Private: Sorry. Crikey. Classified: All right, all right, octopus. Whatever Dave's paying you, I'll double it. Is that a yes? Does anyone speak octopus? Eva: Sorry. Corporal: No, not a clue. Classified: Blast it. You... free... us. We give you... many fishes. Om nom nom nom nom... What is that? Oh, great. Short Fuse: Oh, no! This is it! Corporal: I don't want to die all squishy! Classified: We're dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Oh, no, we're dead! Dead! Dead...! Private: I pushed a button. Corporal: Super. Well done, Private! Eva: Good work, malinki. Classified: Yay. Yes. Yes. Excellent button-pushing. Compliment, praise, et cetera. All right, agents, we are back in business. Private: Wait! Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, all those penguins, they're this way! Classified: And so is a massive army of octopi. And as soon as we return to the North Wind headquarters, grab fresh equipment, and work up a smashing new plan, we'll come speeding back and take down Dave. Private: But the penguins are in danger! We have to go now! Classified: Again, huge army of octopi. Private: So, because you failed once, you're just running away? Classified: We did not fail. And we are not running away. We're just very sensibly regrouping. Private: Skipper wouldn't care. Plan or no, fancy equipment or no... he'd never leave a man behind. Classified: Well, I suppose we can't all be penguins, can we? Private: No. But maybe you should be. Classified: Come on. Dave: Showtime, everyone! Big smiles for the Big Apple! Skipper: Listen up, Doris! You turn us into freaks, and then what? You think that's gonna make everybody love you? Dr. Octavius Brine: No, but they'll despise you. Skipper: Aah! Dr. Octavius Brine: And I'm sure gonna love that. News Reporter: Breaking news! The missing penguins have been found! Okay. According to my notes, genetic researcher Dr. Octavius Brine has found the penguins and is bringing them here to New York's Battery Park. The penguins are coming back! Oh, my gosh! Look! Dr. Octavius Brine: Penguin lovers of the world, guess who I found. New Yorkers: Penguins! Penguins! Dr. Octavius Brine: It wasn't easy, but seeing the penguins get what they deserve will make it all worthwhile. News Reporter: What a weird thing to say! I'm so excited! Dr. Octavius Brine: Do it. Private: Skipper! Skipper! Skipper! Rico! Kowalski! I'm up here! Up here! Skipper: It's like I'm still hearing Private's little voice, calling to us. Private: You have to get out of there! Move! Skipper: “You have a great otter there. Moo.” Kowalski: Why would he moo? Skipper: What are you asking me for? I'm not Private's little ghost.

They turn around, only to notice the Medusa Ray in front of them, ready to fire.

Rico: Uh-oh.

One of Dave's henchmen fires the Medusa Ray at Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and all the penguins, as Private watches in horror.

Private: Noooooo! Dr. Octavius Brine: Are you ready?! New Yorkers: Yeah! Dr. Octavius Brine: Yay...! Your new... and improved... penguins! New Yorkers: Penguins! Penguins! New Yorker: Wha...? Dr. Octavius Brine: Oh, the people love you. Just go give them a hug. New Yorker: Don't let them touch you! Dr. Octavius Brine: Oh, no. What's happening? Nobody likes you anymore? Well, the fun and games are just beginning. Watch this, penguins. Somebody call... the exterminators! And when the exterminators take you away, you never come back. Private: Oh, dear. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. What do I do? What do I do? Crikey! Come on, then. You wanna go? You want some argy-bargy? AAAAHHH!!!

He courageously charges at the octopi like a warrior, much to their surprise.

Private: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yee-haw! Ow. Dr. Octavius Brine: Uh-oh. Missed one. What a wonderful day in the park. Private: Skipper! Wait! Hold on! What are you doing?! Skipper! Don't eat that! Skipper, listen. It's me, Private. I've got a plan, but I need your help. I need my Skipper. Skipper: Private? Private: Yes. That's it. Skipper: Private, you're alive! Oh, God! Kowalski! You've got to get a grip! Private: Kowalski, Eva is worried about you. Kowalski: She is? What did she say? Did she say my name specifically? I mean, were there... were there tears? Details, come on, tell me! Private! You're alive. Come here. This feels a little awkward, but I'm happy. Skipper: Rico! You need to listen to us. I guess you're kind of the same either way. Rico: Private! Skipper: Heads up! Looks like we're back in business, boys. And our business is saving penguin-kind. Who's with me? Kowalski: Count me in. Private: Let's do this! Kowalski: Boo-hah! Private: Yeah! Kowalski: Let's create and feel momentum. Sir, how long do we stand here like this? Skipper: Until we've reached maximum coolness.

The camera keeps circling until it's shot at Skipper, who smiles with confidence.

Skipper: There it is. Now all we need is a plan. Private: I've got one. Skipper: [confused] Eh? Uh, huh?

Private goes over to the ray and takes the Medusa Serum out.

Skipper: You stole Dave's ray? Private: Well, I figured if we could reverse the ray, we could turn everyone back to normal. Skipper: Reverse the ray? Kowalski: That's brilliant! But... it's impossible! In order to reverse the ray, we would need to replace the Medusa Serum with a power source of almost immeasurable cuteness! Skipper: Immeasurable cuteness? Where the heck are we supposed to get that?! No, wait. Private, no! We don't know what that will do to you! Ah! Penguin: All right! Kowalski: The ray! It works! It WORKS! Skipper: Private, are you okay? Private: Yes!

Skipper, Rico and Kowalski gasp in surprise and notice that Private has sprouted a hand out of his buttocks.

Kowalski: Whoa! Butt-hand! There's a hand attached to his butt. That was not... that was not there before.

Private becomes shocked once realizing he has sprouted a butt-hand, which detaches him, but immediately gets used to it.

Skipper: Get out of there. That's an order! Private: [salutes] Permission to defy order. Skipper: Permission denied. Private: Then I deny your denial. Skipper: It's too risky, Private. It already made you sprout a butt-hand! Private: I know it has to be me this time. [places his butt-hand on the glass] And I think you know it too.

Concerned about Private's sacrifice, Skipper places his flipper on the same place where Private placed his butt-hand. They exchange smiles before Private reattaches himself to the ray using his butt-hand.

Private: I'm the secret weapon! Dr. Octavius Brine: I'm happy... and yet... now that I have my revenge, I feel... empty, as if what I needed all along was... more revenge! In fact... Robin, write this down... Tomorrow we move on to kittens! Then puppies, bunnies, pandas... Charlize, they're on the ray! Dave: Helen, hunt them down! William, hurt them. Halle, bury them! Hugh, Jack, man the battle stations! Kevin, bake on! We're still gonna need that victory cake! Skipper: We're only gonna get one shot at this, boys! How we doing on those snow globes? Kowalski: Beam splitter ready! Fire at will! Private: Do it, Skipper! Skipper: Dead batteries?! Kowalski: [gasps] Game over, Skipper! Private: No!

Private then notices a nearby grocery store.

Private: Rico, batteries! Skipper, Kowalski, hold off those octopi! We're doing this NOW! Skipper: You heard Private! Deploy! Aah! Kowalski: Get back, you aquatic savages! Private: Behind you! Beside you! Six o'clock! Twelve o'clock! They're coming from every direction! Kowalski: There's just too many of them! Kowalski: Whoa. Private: You came back! Short Fuse: Oh... that's why you look back at the explosion. Rico: I can dream... Skipper: Fallback positions! Stay away from Private! Dave: Suck it up, Kowalski. Private: No! Dave: It's over, Skipper. Skipper: Over? That's weird. Then why is Rico throwing me a fresh pair of double-A's? Skipper: No! The remote! Skipper: Rico, dibble me! Dave: [evil laughing] Private: Hi-yah! Skipper: It worked! Private! Excuse me. Emergency. Coming through. Make a hole! Make a hole! Kowalski: Don't worry, a chrysalis is just forming around you. That's perfectly normal. Skipper: Private. Rico: Wha...? Skipper: Private? Kowalski: Oh! Look at that! Majestic. Private: Hello. Skipper: Private! Kowalski: Oh! Hey! Private: What's wrong? What are you... Skipper: Look out for the... Private: Have I got something... Kowalski: Okay. Looking out. Skipper: Watch out. Cover your eyes. Private: Is there a... thing? Skipper: Don't turn your head. Private: So, how do I look? Kowalski: You're hideously disfigured and will probably be hunted for sport. Private: [concerned] Wh-Wha...?

Skipper elbows Kowalski.

Kowalski: What? Skipper: If there's anything we've learned on this delightful adventure, Kowalski, it's that looks don't matter. It's what you do what counts. [emotionally] And look at what you did.
